          <p class="lead">Without a great deal of description available for this class, I can only speculate as to the material. I am taking this course for several reasons. Firstly, I have worked to develop different products for use in hospitals, and the complexity of implementation after an idea is generated is potentially prohibitive - without the proper management. With two separate teams, I have been frustrated by a lack of leadership or ineffectual leadership, which has left the development of a project inconsistent at best, and halted at worst. I have learned a great deal about how to motivate and lead a team through trial and error, but I believe that to learn best practices from a expert in management will serve to take this incremental learning process and catapult me to higher effectiveness and performance in current and future management roles. Secondly, I am excited to have the opportunity to be instructed by Dr. Bigelow, who studies organizational behavior, an issue which is relevant to my problem statement. </p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading">Management of Innovation: <span class="text-muted">What did I learn?</span></h2>
            
<p class="lead">Thomas Edison famously said, “genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration”. In this statement is hidden a much more essential truth about Edison. Although he is a named inventor on over 1,000 patents, arguably his most substantial contribution to the world was the notion of a research and development (R&D) lab. In the R&D lab, he united a plurality of stakeholders towards a common purpose; namely, he created an unprecedented environment of collaboration and teamwork, and oversaw the creation of world-changing technologies as a result. </p>

<p class="lead"> In Management of Innovation, we discussed this idea at length. How do companies organize for innovation? How does collaboration and strategic partnership play into bringing technology to market? </p>

<p class="lead"> Often, we found, the factors affecting innovation included a dizzying array of variability, complex interplay, and a diversity of stakeholders. Almost nowhere is this more prevalent than in healthcare. Patients, physicians, hospital administrators, third-party payors, regulators, and medical technology companies all interject their own expectations and motivations into the process of healthcare. </p>

<p class="lead"> Through our discussion, I discovered an interesting insight about how change is made in healthcare: when designing solutions for healthcare, there is a fine line between engaging different stakeholders in the solution, and having a solution that doesn’t have much impact. Said differently, it is crucial to seek input and buy-in from stakeholders (as the unsuccessful retail clinic HealthStop revealed), but seeking too much buy-in can force ideas into molds that don’t challenge the status quo enough to have any impact. In fact, many of the most successful emerging healthcare technologies circumvent some healthcare stakeholders (e.g. Theranos wellness centers at Walgreen’s, where you can buy hundreds of different medical tests, without ever dealing with insurance companies). To strike this balance, I learned, requires a careful mapping of the process you are trying to improve, and thoughtful consideration (or rejection, as it were) of stakeholders’ perspectives. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Healthcare Economics: <span class="text-muted">What did I expect?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">It is often difficult to understand why an industry or institution is a certain way, or to understand the motivation for people actions within these industries without understanding incentives. Economics is not just about money, it provides a holistic framework for understanding the effects of policy and different stakeholders on the behavior of markets and the consumer within them. Nowhere is it more difficult to understand the current state of affairs without understanding this framework than in the health care industry. It is one of the most convoluted, complex systems in our country. I believe that although this complexity is overwhelming, it should be an essential field of study for anyone who is involved in the system (read: everyone!). There is a dazzling amount of misinformation about prices, cost, insurance (and malpractice litigation), quality of care, and differences between different countries’ systems. By taking this course, I hope to gain a sense of how to look at this information critically, and to use evidence-based research to understand why people do what they do, which systems work and don’t work and why, and the roles that different institutions play in effecting how health care is delivered. </p>
            
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Healthcare Economics: <span class="text-muted">What did I learn?</span></h2>
            
            <p class="lead">Before participating in this class, I viewed economics as a field useful largely in financial markets. As it turns out, economics is less of a standalone field, and more of a framework or “lens” for examining behavior of people and systems. To whit, this class introduced me to the use of traditional economic analysis tools to understand why certain things happen the way they do in healthcare. It became clear that health is much more than just healthcare. Health is determined by a myriad of factors, such as education, location, socioeconomic status, lifestyle choices, et cetera. Surprisingly, we also discovered that increased utilization of healthcare is not strongly correlated with increased health, and that rather than decreasing the cost of healthcare, new technology can often increase the cost of healthcare, while only marginally improving the quality of care. Indeed, our reliance on the healthcare system to keep us healthy paradoxically tends to make us pay more for care, while being less healthy than other nations. </p>
            
            <p class="lead">Understanding healthcare requires a critical examination of incentives, and with an economic lens, it becomes possible to analyze these incentives, and the functional outcomes made manifest in the nuances of actions of different healthcare stakeholders. Although my field of study often espouses better technology as a key factor in improving healthcare, an economics lens reveals that there is much more to effecting positive change than that. Namely, some of the largest improvements in healthcare come from business model or behavioral changes that incentivize less utilization of care, lower-technology solutions, and involvement of fewer healthcare third-parties.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Patient Experience Project: <span class="text-muted">What did I expect?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">This class is taught by Dr. Jim Agutter, a professor of architecture. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work closely with him - he has branched out from pure architecture to focus his model of creative design on the health care industry, with the creation of the “Hospital Innovation Center.” The PEP is one of the first pilot programs of the Innovation Center, designed to immerse students in the health care environment through physician shadowing, clinical visits, and interviews with patients, in order to afford students a better understanding of the current standard of care in hospitals. I hope to gain a real sense of how “design thinking” and “active observation” can be used in clinical settings to understand health care delivery and how it can be made more efficient, effective, and appealing to patients and providers. More than anything, I look forward to learning how to engage the different stakeholders in health care, to bring about well-vetted and feasible innovation. </p>
            
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Patient Experience Project: <span class="text-muted">What did I learn?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Sitting across from the director of the Clinical Neurosciences Center (CNC), I felt a sudden a rush of self-doubt. Jim had told us we might have this feeling. Here I was, a junior in bioengineering, and I was here, ostensibly, to offer solutions to some serious problems with the CNC. Specifically, as the director painstakingly outlined, they had a large backlog and not enough physicians available to address it. Some patients, she told me, were waiting 9 months just to get an appointment. This is why we were here - as the director made clear, something had to change.  </p>
            
        <p class="lead">It is easy, I’ve learned, to feel as if you are in over your head when dealing with any healthcare process. Even in just the microcosm of the CNC, we identified at least 7 stakeholders, some of whom had conflicting goals.</p>
            
                    <p class="lead">We had to make sense of this complexity, so we began mapping the pathway a patient takes as they move through the neurology care system. Almost immediately, we saw exactly where the problems were, and even which stakeholders were involved. It was then that I realized the huge value we were poised to provide; we were outside the system, so we could see problems and opportunities with much more clarity than someone who works in the CNC every day. </p>
            
                    <p class="lead">This mapping turned out to be the key to our eventual suggestions. We noticed that often, patients who come to the headache clinic would be fine seeing a general neurologist. To ensure a patient is seeing the right physician, the headache clinic needed to know a few key pieces of information. However, this information was buried in a 10-page questionnaire. This meant that only the patients who filled this out had a chance of being considered, and that there was only one person in the CNC qualified to evaluate the 10 pages of medical information. </p>
            
            <p class="lead">We had the opportunity to present to a group of administrators at the U of U hospital, and our suggestions were twofold. Firstly, we suggested, the information gathering should be staged. The CNC should ask just a few questions at a time, to know what type of physician should see the patient. They’d get more responses, and more patients would get appointments. Secondly, we proposed leveraging other stakeholders to assist in directing patients. By interviewing the expert who reviews the 10-page questionnaire, we hoped to define and document criteria that could be used by schedulers to direct the patient, thus freeing the expert up to 1) evaluate the more difficult cases and 2) see more patients. </p>
            
                    <p class="lead">Ultimately, the project came to a halt, as our solutions seemed to clash with the opinions of many of the administrators. We would have had more success if we had done a few things differently. Firstly, we confined our process mapping to the CNC, which eschewed higher, more logistically- and financially-driven decision-makers. Secondly, we should have presented our solutions much earlier to the CNC and made sure we had their buy-in; we needed to leverage their credibility with administrators. This is often referred to as having “champions” within the organization you’re designing for. Furthermore, we should have asked to present to the CNC and someone who has the perspective of an administrator to ensure that we were communicating our ideas compellingly, and learning about the objections that would inevitably arise when we shared our ideas with the rest of the administrators. </p>
            
                    <p class="lead">It was disappointing, but I’ve seen echoes of these insights permeate everything I’ve designed since I finished the Patient Experience Project. </p>
