          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Launch CerviGauge: <span class="text-muted">What did I expect?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">I plan to return to Bench to Bedside next year, as well as the Utah Entrepreneur Series, armed with the incredible experience I’ve had this year. These competitions have proven to be indispensable in terms of understanding logistical requirements of innovating in health care (and otherwise). There are several significant benefits to engaging in these competitions. Firstly, the ability to learn communication skills required for success in the field of product development: inherent in these competitions is the necessity to concisely and effectively present information in written form and verbal and graphic forms. Secondly, there are milestones set in place by the organizers of both competitions, which serve to provide a framework of essential elements that need to be built up and prepared before a product idea can be pitched. Thirdly, and most importantly in my opinion, the people who volunteer as judges and attend these events are some of the biggest movers and shakers in the space of medical innovation, and are invited due to their affinity for mentoring and working with student teams. These are incredible networking opportunities. (Caveat: these events are good for potential funding events, but success or failure in winning prize money does not represent feasibility or commercial viability of teams involved). </p>
            
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Launch CerviGauge: <span class="text-muted">What did I learn?</span></h2>
            
            <p class="lead">He looked a little silly sitting there. I remember him grabbing our CerviGauge device at the Mentor Workshop and sticking it on to his fingers to try it out. I smiled to myself, because the look on his face made me think that he had no idea what it was for, but he was excited about it anyway. </p>
            
            <p class="lead">How could it be? He actually turned out to be our mentor for the Utah Entrepreneur Challenge. He had no experience in the medical field at all, so this surprised me a bit. He had started, sold, or otherwise been involved in 10 or so startup companies, though, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. </p>
            
            <p class="lead">My second impression turned out to be right - he single-handedly taught me, by example, the power of mentorship. We were decent engineers, but we had no idea what we were doing when it came to customer interfacing, fundraising, strategic partnership, or pitching. In fact, I didn’t even know what some of those things were. And as it turns out, Google does not dispense quality business advice. These were things you have to hear about from someone who has been in your shoes - I just didn’t know it. </p>
            
            <p class="lead">Indeed, he didn’t have any medical industry experience, and that’s exactly what made him the best advisor we had. As it turned out, we had been completely engrossed in exploring nuances of our product’s design, and had neglected exploring the business concept feasibility. In one of our first meetings, he called me out. He told me the team was half-assing it, he said that our pitch made him sleepy, and he said that we weren’t leveraging our student status nearly enough. It was all difficult to hear, but he was right. </p>
            
            <p class="lead">He taught me to think of the biggest risks in the business, and face them head on. For us, this included getting in front of our customers, both users AND buyers (often not the same stakeholder) and designing narratives that would resonate with people who weren’t engineers (for CerviGauge, mothers in labor, obstetricians, hospital purchasers, and investors). He taught me to focus on vision as a guiding principle for activity in the company. He reminded me of the power of asking for help - he had also started a business in college - and that I could get tens of thousands of dollars of free advice just by slipping “I’m a student...” into emails to professionals. </p>
            
            <p class="lead">Most of all, he taught me how to be scrappy. Whenever we hemmed and hawed about the money we’d need to get something done, he’d calmly ask, “do you really need money to do that?” Slowly, I began to see the world a little bit differently: even in the medical industry, some of the most important early milestones in developing a company are free, with a little bit of creativity. Most businesses, I learned, don’t fail because they don’t have the money to grow. They fail because the founders are focused on the wrong things. Therein lies the most valuable aspect of the Utah Entrepreneur Series: each time I competed, I met 1-3 people who ended up as advisers, and changed the way I think about business, and my own capabilities of launching one. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Lead ASB Vancouver: <span class="text-muted">What did I expect?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">I will be leading a service and education trip to the city of Vancouver over spring break in 2013 through the Alternative Spring Break program. This program sends teams of 11 students and a staff member to 11 different sites along the west coast to become immersed in community service and collaboration with citizens of these cities to deal with environmental, social, or sustainability issues. The trip to Vancouver is an in-depth look at the Canadian health care system, which combines service in clinical settings and education about the differences between the Canadian and the US systems. I led a trip to the Rio Mesa center this spring break, and I had rare opportunity to both learn organizational and planning skills, and to be in an official leadership position. The opportunities afforded by this position are amazing - it is a crash course in managing people, how to settle disputes, motivate groups, and lead group discussions effectively, all in a very low-pressure environment. </p>
            
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Lead ASB Vancouver: <span class="text-muted">What did I learn?</span></h2>
            
                      <p class="lead">I haven’t found many other opportunities that pair autonomy and mentorship as effectively as does ASB. I had the freedom to design the one-week trip from the ground up, and used that opportunity to find organizations that explored the complex relationships between patients, the healthcare system, community service organizations, culture, and the government. All the while, I had a peer group of site leaders going through the same process, and a coordinator that had been a site leader several times before. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">In a way, it felt very similar to my experiences in building companies: my trip participants were “customers”, in that I had to truly understand them to design a meaningful experience for them. My staff partner was like a “co-founder”, in that we selected each other from a pool of other potential collaborators because of our complementary skill sets. Lastly, the organizations I worked with were like temporary “strategic partners”. I had to learn how to cold contact them, engage them to talk with me, pitch them on my trip, and persuade them to add some of their resources towards a mutually beneficial project. It was a blast. I failed so many times at different stages of negotiation with organizations, but got better and better each time. I learned the power of understanding and emulating the value system or mission of the organization, and communicating my proposal to them in terms of this mission. I also experienced, again, the immense power of “champions” when I happened to meet a woman who was well-known within the community service community in Vancouver. She loved the project, and suddenly so many doors started opening that I had to politely decline some organizations’ offers to collaborate with us. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">In Vancouver, we were blown away by how much “health” care was happening outside of the “healthcare” system. We saw instances of organizations that were so much more effective at providing care because they existed outside the traditional healthcare system, and thus did not have to answer to certain key stakeholders, such as hospital administrators and insurance companies. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">These organizations were also small, and so could afford to specialize in solving a very specific problem. One organization, called InSite, provided one simple service: if you are doing drugs, you can come to InSite and do them safely, under the care of a registered nurse. It seemed so counterintuitive, amidst so many drug addiction organizations that seek to stop drug use, but the results were amazing. By focusing directly on solving the addicts’ biggest problems (disease from needle-sharing and overdosing), InSite was able to dramatically improve peoples’ lives. Furthermore, they built trust and rapport with addicts, which allowed them a position of credibility from which to suggest further treatment and addiction counseling. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">This revealed a very interesting insight about healthcare: by focusing on a certain problem and solving it very well, it is possible to redefine how a stakeholder interacts with the system. E.g. homeless people are a public health nightmare, with coincident mental illness, drug addiction, and often STDs. Therefore, although they are deeply in need of healthcare, they are not well-served by the current healthcare system. By solving one of the addicts’ most pressing problems, InSite is creating new opportunity for everyone to be more effective. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">Each group of people we met were improving health in such creative ways, and it completely altered the way I approach problems in healthcare. Start by solving the problem a patient has really well, and magic happens. </p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Build a medical company: <span class="text-muted">What did I expect?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">A true understanding of why innovation in healthcare is so difficult will be informed by theoretical coursework, and even through student projects such as those for Bench-to-Bedside and the Patient Experience Project. However, the best learning is done hands-on. Therefore, I hope to start my own medical device company that is beyond the scope of any student competitions. I hope to learn how to navigate the process of taking an idea from conception, to product development, to product, to company, and finally to the market. Through this, I hope to gain a deep understanding of what aspects of this process are most difficult, and where this process can be innovated. I also hope, through this process, to interface with the myriad stakeholders in healthcare, and learn strategies for connecting them in unprecedented ways to bring a revolutionary healthcare technology to market. </p>
            
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Build a medical company: <span class="text-muted">What did I learn?</span></h2>
            
                      <p class="lead"><b>Get on the court.</b> That’s what one of my mentors says. It doesn’t matter how small the project, just build something, sell something, start something. There are ideas, and there is execution. And execution, as it turns out, comprises a vast skill set that transcends any one idea. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">Looking backward, I had gotten on the court in several instances. I started small, by developing a novel wound dressing for a class competition. I had tried to build a novel cervical dilation device with a small team (1 engineer, 1 MBA student, 1 medical student), and then tried to pitch this device as a game-changing innovation for obstetricians. I had organized, coordinated and led a service trip to Vancouver. I had worked with clinicians to try and find novel process designs to ameliorate the huge patient backlog at a clinic at the U hospital. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">These projects all had varying degrees of success, but more importantly, each project was a vehicle by which I could hone my ability to turn thought experiments into implementable solutions. I didn’t know it, but I was preparing for the moment where a really big idea came across my radar. I was honing my ability to execute. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">That big idea floated across my radar in the spring of 2012. I had just seen Clayton Christensen, the innovation economist, speak about the disruption that was happening in medicine. He argued that key technologies would drastically simplify certain medical procedures, which would allow lesser-trained providers (e.g. nurses rather than physicians) or lower-cost venues of care (e.g. retail clinics rather than hospitals) to perform the same procedures.
</p>
            
                      <p class="lead">Concurrently, my father (a PhD biochemist turned biotech startup consultant), brother (BS/MS candidate in bioengineering), and I had been talking about a new, at-home medical test for HIV that had just been approved by the FDA. Something clicked, and we realized that this was exactly the type of technology that Christensen had been referencing.
</p>
            
                      <p class="lead">We immediately jumped on the whiteboard, and starting drawing out ideas for our own version of an at-home medical test, one that could be performed outside of the hospital, simple enough for anyone to use. We realized that the expensive and cumbersome part of diagnostic tests was not the test itself, but the computer or instrument used to run it.
</p>
            
                      <p class="lead">So why not just get rid of that expensive, cumbersome computer, and just build a test that could be run by the supercomputers that 200 million Americans already have in their pocket? </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">We did. And we called it iTest. Healthcare in your pocket. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">I’ve been working on iTest for over two years now. Here are some things I’ve learned. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead"><b>Healthcare is being disrupted right now.</b> For the last 50 or so years, healthcare has been the exclusive purview of hospitals and trained health professionals. These days, there are “boutique” clinics (private practice clinics that don’t interface with insurance companies), “retail” clinics (stores that treat a small number of health conditions on a walk-in basis, and don’t employ any physicians), and “wellness centers” (places where you can walk in and give a blood sample and order any number of tests from thousands of options). There are also devices that connect to your smartphone and track your fitness (FItBit), your basic vital signs (Scanadu), and that even perform ECGs (AliveCor). The traditional business model of centralized healthcare is being chipped away at, piece by piece. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead"><b>Healthcare is change-averse. You must find champions.</b> A company called Health Stop was one of the first of these “retail” clinics. They promised less waiting time and lower costs for basic healthcare, potentially relieving local ERs from unnecessary and trivial workload. Yet, they failed to seek proper buy-in from the medical industry, and were driven out of business when physicians and administrators from these same local hospitals publicly denounced their quality of care. This led to an interesting article called <a href="https://hbr.org/2006/05/why-innovation-in-health-care-is-so-hard" target="_blank">"Why Innovation in Healthcare is So Hard"</a>. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">The healthcare industry is not change-averse because people aren’t intelligent. On the contrary, they are highly intelligent, care deeply about their patients, and even are well aware of the disruption that is occurring. It’s change-averse because there is a great deal of inertia and complex relationships within the healthcare system, which make connecting stakeholders in new ways difficult. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">This, we realized early on, is why you need advocates within the system. Advocates pave the way, using their credibility and reputation to help you reach the right stakeholders. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead"><b>You can’t do it all, but it sure is tempting to try.</b> Early on, we envisioned ourselves as a one-stop shop for the research, development, engineering, manufacturing, sales, and distribution of medical diagnostics. We also planned to work on data management and analytics on the back end of the tests. It was an exciting vision, and one that well-meaning people encouraged us to chase, but for a small company it was way too much. We were spread much too thin, and did not accomplish any significant product development in over a year. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">This is the opposite of what most successful companies do: to start off with a very narrow scope of activities, and strive to the be the best at a niche. For example, Apple 2014 controls every level of design, production, sales, content, and backend support for their products. However, Apple began merely by hand-crafting and selling computer motherboards. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">We’ve learned, albeit the hard way. We now call out one-year, 18-month, and 2-year goals, and determine exactly what we need to (and don’t need to) deliver each quarter to reach those goals. These deliverables become our priorities (1-3 per person in our company), and when we plan our weeks, any task that doesn’t meet our priorities is scrapped. Focus = efficacy and efficiency. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">Along with the above, <b>anyone who tells you that starting a business means you need to work 100-hour weeks is lying to you.</b> Or they are just extremely inefficient. Unfortunately, I majorly bought into this most of 2013. I worked 80-hour weeks on top of being a full-time student. My life was severely unbalanced. I was convinced that this is just what you do in a startup company. I now work on my company around 30 hours a week, and get much more done. Focus = efficacy and efficiency. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead"><b>Being students has been invaluable to our success.</b> We learned long ago that there are magic words that will get you 1) meetings that nobody else can get, 2) tens of thousands of dollars of free consulting, 3) free labor from collaborators, 4) free material from vendors, 5) funding, 6) advisers, and hundreds of other things. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">What are these magic words? “Hi, I’m a student working on _. Can you help me?” These words have gotten us meetings, people, and resources we could have never afforded otherwise. Imagine my surprise - I originally thought it would be harder to start a business as a student due to credibility issues. As I’ve started to learn, it is the perfect time to start a business. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead"><b>If you don’t know, be shameless and ask someone.</b> We started this project with many more questions than answers. And not much has changed. We have learned a lot, but with each lesson comes new questions. Some of the main reasons business fail are 1) they see the biggest risks in their business concept and avoid facing them until too late, 2) they don’t see the biggest risks in their business concept, and fail without realizing why. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">I’ve worked with a few “adults” who felt like they didn’t need to ask for help. They had enough  experience that if they did things the way they’d done them for the last 30 years, everything would work out. However, being the shameless students that we are, when we don’t know something, we ask someone who probably does. And they can usually help us. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">Some interesting side benefits (which turned out to be the MAIN benefits): </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">1. <b>We accrued a network of (now) 24 advisers.</b> We never asked them directly to be our advisers, we just asked for help. It’s a low-pressure way of saying, “let’s see if we like working together.” </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">2. <b>We inadvertently developed a low-risk hiring methodology.</b> We don’t “interview” people, we have on-the-job auditions. For advisers, consultants, team members, and interns. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead">3. <b>We are leveraging a huge collective IQ.</b>  We have met incredible people. And they know other incredible people. This allows us a massive extended network, and we are solving problems that we didn’t know how to solve before, and revealing problems we didn’t know we had at all. </p>
            
                      <p class="lead"><b>Healthcare innovation is complex, but it doesn’t have to be difficult.</b> There are many moving parts in a business. It can be hard to know which to prioritize, and at what stage of the company. For healthcare products, add a strict set set of quality control regulations on top of a normal business’s challenges, and you’ve got a lot of reasons that healthcare companies should fail. </p>
            
                    <p class="lead">That’s why we’ve started focusing a great deal on learning from the brightest people we can find in each area of expertise and documenting their methods, as well as our own mistakes and successes. In the spirit of <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/11/health-care-needs-less-innovation-and-more-imitation" target="_blank">a recent brilliant HBR article</a>, our hope is to one day be able to release an “open-source” how-to manual that any new venture could read, edit, and improve upon, to spread best practices for how to start a medical technology company. </p>

        <div class="col-md-7">
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Run a Foundry cohort: <span class="text-muted">What did I expect?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The Foundry bills itself as a place where entrepreneurs can grow their businesses as part of a peer-to-peer mentoring cohort. I know several companies that graduated from the Foundry, and I am always amazed at the amount of progress in their ventures. They claim a large part of their success is from principles they learned while in the Foundry. Participating in the Utah Entrepreneur Series has been instrumental in helping me develop a lot of confidence in approaching new ventures, but the feedback only occurs a couple of times a year, and is from judges who aren’t very familiar with my business. By participating in the first FoundrySLC cohort in the summer of 2014, I hope to have regular feedback from a group of people who know me and my venture well. I hope this regular feedback helps me iterate continuously towards better practices in rigorously testing business assumptions and building a durable, efficient venture. </p>
            
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Run a Foundry cohort: <span class="text-muted">What did I learn?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Why these long meetings where nothing gets accomplished? Why politics and “privileged information”? Why factions within the company? Why the misalignment between different peoples’ priorities and activities? Why the constant status updates? In autumn of 2013, iTest had become fairly dysfunctional. It wasn’t anyone’s fault, really; it was a matter of a lot of people outside the company pulling us in different directions, and <b>us not having a transparent means to ensure that we continued to use our time effectively and efficiently.</b> </p>     
            
                      <p class="lead">Running a startup, one of my mentors always says, is like riding a motorcycle. Except that the motorcycle is going 100 mph. And as you drive it, you’re also trying to tinker with it to make it go faster. </p> 
            
                      <p class="lead">This, I’ve found, is a very apt metaphor. I had done many projects before, but now I was aspiring to actually build a profitable, high-growth company where there had been none before. Simultaneously, we were trying to figure out HOW in the world people build profitable, high-growth companies where there had been none before. I know - meta. </p> 
            
                      <p class="lead">This process wasn’t going well. We were moving forward, sure, but there was no way our company could scale using the current practices. We resolved to start a documentation process. Each week, we’d remind ourselves of our mission, then list our progress from the last week on that mission, then our plans for the next week. </p> 
            
                      <p class="lead">Bizarrely, we got invited to join the first cohort of FoundrySLC, and found that they used almost an identical documentation methodology. They told us they had “borrowed” the document system from companies like Intel and Google, and that the documents provided a validated framework on which a durable venture could be built. </p> 
            
                      <p class="lead">As we started to get into the cohort, I found another reason that companies fail: they go it alone. Conversely, in the Foundry, we had quarterly and weekly plans that a group of 11 other companies reviewed meticulously. As we got to know them over several months, the feedback got harsher and more helpful. </p> 
            
                      <p class="lead">Part of these weekly plans was that each company identified a problem that was holding them back from progressing. Each problem had more than 15 pairs of eyes on it, and I was blown away by the incredible solutions that materialized. Especially from people in completely different industries. One examples of the amazing leverage these documents provided was our first problem. I had spent the entire spring trying to find a certain kind of engineer, and had mostly failed. I put this as a problem, assuming that the group app developers, nutrition experts, and accountants that made up the rest of my cohort wouldn’t be able to provide me any value on such a specific topic. When I next looked at my problem, I had 7 suggestions, which yielded two of the exact type of consultant we needed. <b>The power of the collective IQ is so much greater than one or two minds.</b> </p> 
            
                      <p class="lead">More importantly, the intense transparency of our cohort bred a culture of extreme results-orientation, accountability, knowledge-sharing, and designing tests to challenge business assumptions. These were things we had struggled through hell to try and implement into our company, and here was a group that seemed to adopt them almost as a matter of course. </p> 
            
                      <p class="lead">I noticed that I was not only thinking about my business differently, but all of the activities I engaged in. I found myself thinking 1) is what I’m doing right now adding to a higher purpose? 2) how much of what I planned to do this week did I actually do, and why? and 3) who could I ask that could give me best practices for what I’m trying to learn right now?</p> 
            
                      <p class="lead">I enjoyed the summer so much that I volunteered to co-facilitate the autumn cohort of FoundrySLC, and it has been a crash course in designing culture, peer-to-peer mentoring, and leveraging the collective IQ. We’ve used this experience to slowly implement these practices into our own business, and we’re making more progress on the things that matter than ever before. </p>
